# Path-Finding-Visualizer
Application built using tkinter and pygame to search the best path on grid using different algorithms.
Allows to pick starting and ending point on a grid and block chosen points to make "walls".
Then it finds the shorthest path between these two nodes using one of implemented algorithms:

  - a* search
  - djikstra
  - breath first search
  - depth first search
